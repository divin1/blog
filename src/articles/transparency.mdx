# Data & Privacy

I strive to be a person with strong integrity. Honesty and transparency are core to everything that I publish.

The goal of this article is to describe everything related to data, privacy, ads, affiliations and analytics in the context of this blog.

I'm awalys open to feedback and suggestions, feel free to get in touch at <a href="mailto:divicolas@gmail.com">divicolas [at] gmail.com</a>.


## Ads

I do not plan on adding any ads since I believe ads negatively impact the experience of users, especially in blogs. Also, being profitable is not the main goals of this blog.


## Affiliations

Articles may contain affiliate links, I will explicitly state it whenever that's the case.


## Analytics

I use [Microanalytics](https://microanalytics.io/), a simple and privacy-friendly analytics service. It is fully compliant with GDPR, PECR and CCPA, created and hosted in EU and powered by green energy.
