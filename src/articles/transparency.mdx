# Data & Privacy

I strive to be a person with strong integrity. In everything I publish on my blog I want to be honest and transparent. Hence why I believe this article is important.

This article covers all fundamental data and privacy concerns a visitor of my blog might be interested in.

I'm awalys open to feedback, if you have any suggestions in this regard feel free to get in touch at <a href="mailto:divicolas@gmail.com">divicolas [at] gmail.com</a>.


## Ads

I don't like ads and, especially in blogs, I feel they negatively impact the experience of visitors and readers. Also, being profitable is not one of the main goals of this blog. For these reasons I won't add any ads to my blog.


## Affiliations

I will explicitly and clearly state whenever a link is an affiliate one. This is mostly the case when linking external resources, such as books.


## Analytics

I use Google Analytics to track activity on the website, hence the use of cookies (it is intrinsic to Google Analytics).

### Why

It's simple: I find basic analytics essential because they allow me to see how many visitors I have, which articles are being read, which ones are the most popular and so on. This serves as a guide on what kind of content I should focus on.

### Why Google Anayltics

It is free, simple and easy to integrate. I don't need fancy analytics, all I want to know is if anyone is reading my blog and what they're reading.

### What is being tracked

I send an event to Google Analytics every time a page is visited with the name of the page. That's it.

Google Analytics automatically includes further information about visitors, such as the the browser used, device-related information and country.

Here's a sreenshot of the dashboard to give you an idea of what this actually looks like.

I set data retention to 2 months, after which data is automatically deleted, and I chose to identify users by device only, instead of device and User ID.
