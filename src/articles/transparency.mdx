# Transparency

## Advertisment

I don't like ads in blogs, I feel like they greatly and negatively impact the experience of the reader. For this reason I aim to keep my blog free from any form of from advertisment.

## Analytics

I use Google Analytics to track activity on the website, hence the use of cookies (it is intrinsic to Google Analytics).

### Why

It's simple: I like data and data analysis. Exploiting anyltics allows me to see how many visitors I have, which articles are they reading, which ones are the most popular and so on.

### Why Google Anayltics

It is free, simple enough and easy to integrate. I don't need fancy or complex analytics, all I want to know is if anyone is reading my blog and what they're reading.

### What is being tracked

I send an event to Google Analytics every time a page. In the event I include an identifier for the page, so that I know which page has been visited, this is usually the URL or part of it. That's it, I leave the rest to Google.

Google Analytics automatically includes other information such as the the browser used, operative system, device information and country of users. I noticed I had visitors from all over the globe and I found that quite interesting.

Here's a sreenshot of the dashboard to give you an idea of what this actually looks like.

I set data retention to 2 months, after which data is automatically deleted, and I chose to identify users by device only, instead of device and User ID.

## Affiliations

In my articles I might use affiliate links or provide referral codes or similar. Integrity is among the things I value the most, and therefore in cases where I do this I will be upfront and state it explicitly.
