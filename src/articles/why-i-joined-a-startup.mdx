# Why I Joined A Startup

Year is 2019, I had just graduated and it was time to find a job to join the workforce.

I was overwhelmed with fear, but not because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find a job, I was scared by what it all meant.
Essentially, it meant that _fun_ time was over, it was time to _grow up_ and start living a _serious_ adult life, full of duty and responsibility, typically stale and devoid of curiosity and fun.
I saw the colors were fading to gray.

Traditional corporate was never appealing to me for many reasons and, among the many uncertainties, I knew I wanted to a job with essentially three things: I wanted to develop highly valuable skills, I wanted an environment that would endorse and value exploration, curiosity and fun, and finally, I wanted meaning.

**Developing highly valuable skills**

I like to look at jobs as investments: I invest my time into a company and in return I get money and experience.
And like with every investment, I want to maximize the returns.
A common mistake, I believe, is to maximize money early on. In the short term, one might get a slight head start, and this gives them the illusion that this is a good strategy.
In the long run however, their progress will be linear and in very small steps, because monetary returns are strictly tied to the value that we bring to a company, and the person that only maximizes money will improve very little.
Therefore to efficiently maximize money, one has to maximize the development of skills that are most valuable.

So, what are these highly valuable skills?
The foundation is made of technical skills, that is the specialized knowledge and abilities to perform the job itself, and they are acquired by being challenged with different technically complex problems over and over again.
The importance of the _practical_ aspect of learning is what striked me instantly when I started working, I instantly realized that I knew nothing, I was standing at the base of an infinite mountain, my climb had just started. All I had learned in years of university was nothing but absolute basics and in the _real_ world was nothing but another, continuous, degree.

To maximize the acquisition of technical skills I had to be directly involved in solving these technically complex problems as much as possible. I sought high degrees of responsibility and freedom of action.
But which company would be crazy enough to give a guy with zero experience this much responsibility and freedom? A company that _moves fast and breaks things_.
And startups are exactly that: innovative, wild and truly agile (I really dislike this word).
Startups scale exponentially, and as they scale, their individuals scale exponentially with them.
Corporates cannot offer this. They have bulky and clumsy bodies, made of deep hierarchies and countless layers. Innovation doesn't happen at all or is simply too slow to matter, it becomes more like [_keeping up with the Joneses_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses). Their deep hierarchies make it hard to have high degrees of responsibility and freedom if you're just starting out, I get it, they often cannot simply afford to _break things_.
Consequently, responsibility and freedom must follow the hierarchy, _the problem_ is broken down and unevenly distributed across the many people, nearly nullifying the impact possible for individuals.

(And as much as big corporates like to throw words such as "modern" and "agile" in their job offerings, they can't hide the fact that they cannot even tie their shoes without formally asking the arms, hands and back departments' approval for action.)

I mentioned innovation and I think it is important. There aren't many things to learn from companies who really don't want or need to improve their product in a significant matter, who don't seek, or even are afraid of innovation. Innovation means work, a lot of work, and corporate doesn't like it, they prefer their comfy leather chairs.
I, on the other hand, was craving for it.

**The environment**

An individual's potential can only be at most what is given to them by their company by means of responsibility and freedom. In other words, one's potential can be freed or limited by their environment.

I sought an environment that would endorse and value innovation, creativity and fun. As I mentioned before, corporares are bulky and slow, this creates are rather stale environment. Corporate people are notorious for seeking comfort and being satisfied with a never-changing routine. That's the opposite of what I wanted. Never-changing routines and comfort both scared me to death.
Startups, on the other hand, are in a constant run against the clock because time is money, and in startups money is highly limited. Discomfort lives naturally in startups and is the mother of continuous growth. It's do or die, all or nothing. That sounds much better to me.

I think company size has a lot to do with why startups are able to be so productive compared to big corporations.
Their teams are small and highly efficient, each person is hired specifically and to match the work load, there are no excesses because they cannot be afforded.
A small team makes it possible to communicate directly and efficiently, there are no layers, so that every person is exposed to the full creative process (design, development, sales, etc.), pushing each other, and growing and achieving success together. Truly, _unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno_.
Romanticism aside, startups have limited resources and invest them all in development, startups are _lean_ and deliver _pure_ solutions.

We're currently working a bit on our image, for years our company website was a Wix template and our logo was made using Microsoft Word.

Our product, on the other hand, is amazingly sophisticated.

**Meaning**

I wanted to take part in something meaningful, I wanted to know that what I was going to dedicate years of my time to, actually mattered.

I had no interest in joining a company where you maintain an obsolete and fragile infrastructure, built on ancient technology, or where you continuously perform uninteresting tasks.
I'm human, I can think, and I can create, what purpose would it be to become nothing short of a machine?

For myself to perform the best, I have to care about what I do and firmly believe in the vision we are working towards.
I wanted to build something new, revolutionize processes and industries, help and empower people.

**Conclusion**

I chose to be part of a startup. Looking back at all my insecurities and uncertainties I had at the beginning, I am certain I made the right choice, I found my home.

Sure, there have been good and bad times, I had to cope with a lot of work and stress, but I loved every moment of it.

I get to learn a lot about everything, from technical things to how to approach sales, and I end up including many of these concepts into my private life. Improving my persona, as if I were a _lean_ and _focused_ product.

Don't get me wrong, I know I'm fortunate to be where I am, and while most people hate their jobs, I can't wait for Monday.

Let's do it, let's change the world.
